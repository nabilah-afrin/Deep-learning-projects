The project focuses on learning several NLP techniques for example, Tokenizing, Stemming, Embedding to classify toxic online comments on social media. LSTM was developed to classify the comments, and 2 other algorithms were also compared with LSTM in order to showcase the success rate of LSTM in NLP application.

### Dataset
Our dataset for the problem is collected from Kaggle, named Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification.
